I. Experimental Environment
The experimental environment is built on the Python 3.8 platform, using PyTorch 2.0.0 as the machine learning library.
Experiments are conducted on an Ubuntu 20.04 platform equipped with 60G RAM and an AMD EPYC 7T83 (32-core) processor.

II. Computational Overhead Analysis

Time Complexity Analysis

(1) Siamese Network Module:
Encoder time complexity: O(d₁×h + h×h + h×d₂) ≈ O(h²)
h: hidden layer dimension; d₁: state dimension; d₂: output dimension
Projection head time complexity: O(d₂² + d₂²) ≈ O(d₂²)
Prediction head time complexity: O(d₂² + d₂²) ≈ O(d₂²)
Total time complexity of the Siamese network module: O(h² + d₂²) ≈ O(h²)

(2) Policy Network Time Complexity
O(D×h + h×h + h×A) ≈ O(h²)
D: agent observation dimension
A: agent action dimension

(3) Residual Network Time Complexity: O(d₂×h + h×h + h×1) ≈ O(h²)

(4) Training Process Time Complexity: O(B×L×h²)
Total time complexity: O(N×h²)

Space Complexity Analysis

Total space of experience replay buffer: O(B×L×(N×D + S + N×A))
S: state dimension

Space complexity: the dominant term is O(N×D) (where B and L are constants)
